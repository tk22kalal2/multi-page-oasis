      "question": "Which bone forms the posterior part of the hard palate?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Maxilla",
        "B": "Palatine bone",
        "C": "Sphenoid bone",
        "D": "Vomer"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The palatine bone forms the posterior part of the hard palate. The maxilla forms the anterior part of the hard palate, while the palatine bone contributes to the posterior portion.",

    {
      "q_no": 2,
      "question": "The foramen magnum is located in which bone?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Temporal bone",
        "B": "Sphenoid bone",
        "C": "Occipital bone",
        "D": "Parietal bone"
      },
      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "The foramen magnum is the large opening in the occipital bone through which the spinal cord connects to the brainstem. It is the largest foramen in the skull.",

    {
      "q_no": 3,
      "question": "Which muscle is responsible for the primary action of shoulder abduction?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Deltoid",
        "B": "Supraspinatus",
        "C": "Infraspinatus",
        "D": "Teres minor"
      },
      "correct_answer": "A",
      "explanation": "The deltoid muscle is the primary muscle responsible for shoulder abduction. While the supraspinatus initiates abduction, the deltoid takes over as the main abductor of the arm.",
      "chapter_heading": "Upper Limb Muscles"
    },
    {
      "q_no": 4,
      "question": "The biceps brachii muscle has how many heads?",
      "options": {
        "A": "One",
        "B": "Two",
        "C": "Three",
        "D": "Four"
      },
      "correct_answer": "B",
      "explanation": "The biceps brachii muscle has two heads: the long head and the short head. The long head originates from the supraglenoid tubercle, while the short head originates from the coracoid process.",

    {
      "q_no": 5,
      "question": "Which nerve supplies the diaphragm?",
      "options": {
        "A": "Vagus nerve",
        "B": "Phrenic nerve",
        "C": "Intercostal nerves",
        "D": "Accessory nerve"
